Scrum Notes:
03/06/23

Agenda:

- Add new Deliverable Tasks to Kanban Board
- Update Deliverable Kanban board
- Establish Individual goals / responsibilities


Upcoming Assignments:

- Assignment 3 - March 12th @ midnight
- Deliverable 3 – 15% – Due date: March 26th, 2023, 11:59PM Eastern Time


Group suggestion:

 - What if we agreed to have all deliverable content done and ready to submit by Saturday to avoid 
	Sunday scheduling conflicts?


Group Consensus:

- Yes, we all think that's agreeable. However, lets aim for 5pm Saturday to preserve Saturday afternoons
	as free time for individuals.


Also:

-  Friday's meeting (03/10/23) will not be held in person or online.
	- Reason: we won't have work to collaborate on by then. If you need help with Assignment 3 then
		post in the group discord for support.
