# Development
This project uses Python 3.11, create a conda environment called `flask`
```
conda create --name flask python=3.11
```
Run this to install Python dependencies (when at base directory):  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run this to start the Flask development server (it refreshes when files are changed):
```
 flask --debug run
```
