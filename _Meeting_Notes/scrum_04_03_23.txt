Main Points:

- Looked at Feedback for Deliverable 3
	- Only need to fix minor changes to sequence diagrams tables
	- Everything else good!

- Looked at descriptions of new development documents
	- Confusion over configuration management plan?
		- Is it still due for this Deliverable or not?
		- Can't judge what need to do for CMP
		- Will go over in lecture tomorrow
		- Sepideh said it might be pushed back, too
	- Mainly need to look at Detailed Design Doc

- Focus on ability to view recipes in development for now
	- Temporarily ignore improving log in
	- Focus on being able to click summaries to look at recipes

- Nick reorganized Docker files

- Unsure level of progress on backend because of Tyler's absense

- Discussion: Should we use Flask or Django so that we can pull it together?
	- Decided Flask

Takeaways:
- Only update needed to Deliverable 3 material is a slight change on Sequence Diagrams
- Ignoring Configuration Management Plan for now
	- Someone needs to message Prof/TA to ask about it
- Main focus for Friday's meeting should be DCD
- Development should focus on viewing recipes
- Need to check in with Tyler about backend progress
- Will be using Flask for project

Goals:

- Think about design patterns for Friday where we'll do group work on the DCD
- Work on development as described above and discussed in meeting
