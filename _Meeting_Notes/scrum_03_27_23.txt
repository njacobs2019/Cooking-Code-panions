Scrum Master: Kass
Product Manager: Nick

Agenda:
- Pick Product Manager

- Progress report on where development is at
- Figure out what needs to get done this week

Upcoming Deadlines:

- Deliverable 4 due 4/09

Main Points:

- Discussed Mongo vs Firebase

- Current Progress: frontend and half of backend
	- Some more progress on stylizing the frontend that needs to be pushed to GitHub
	- Unsure how to link pages?
		- Found some explanations online in ReactJS tutorials

- Discussion: does backend match architecture type?

Takeaways:

- Decided to go with Mongo
- Figured out how to learn to link pages
- Need to make sure to do new development in a new branch
- Need to assess whether our code matches the architecture type we chose

Goals:

--> Get more dev done on frontend, especially adding new pages
--> Start setting up database
--> Each pick one design pattern that would work with our application

- Work on developement at same rate, more if you haven't been
- Think of design pattern by Friday
	- May use time to let people start on Assignment 4
